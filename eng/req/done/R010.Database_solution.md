#### Story:
As a developer<br/>
I want to select database solution that makes sense for startups<br/>
So that I can create a dynamic application

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Heroku Postgres database
   - Pros:
     - Fully managed database
     - Integrates very well with Heroku apps
   - Cons:
     - Heroku Postgres is expensive.
     - You only get a single database. So, you need to spend money per application to get database.
     - Most developers will want to use SQL Server with Asp.net application. Postgres is not a first solution for Microsoft developers.
     - Postgres database development tools are no match with SQL Server Data Tools(SSDT).
1. Install and manage your own SQL Server Express database on Digital Ocean. 
   - Pros:
     - You can create multiple databases on a single server. It is very cost effective if you expect to create a lot of application.
   - Cons:
     - Backups needs to be taken manually.
     - Need to create and continuously update SSL certificate.
     - SQL Server Express cannot be configured for replications or automatic fail overs.
     - SQL Server Express limit database size to 10GB.
     - SQL Server Express limit processor utilization to 2 cores.
     - SQL Server Express limit memory utilization to 2GB.
     - SQL Server Express doesn't have SQL Server Agent. (But this could be counted as pro too because Azure SQL Single Database doesn't support SQL Server agent either.)
   - Notes:
     - If your database every need larger database or more cores or memory, the you can easily move to Azure Single Database solution.
1. Azure SQL Database Single Database
   - Pros:
     - Very cost effective. Starts at less than $4.8971 per month for 2GB of database.
     - Can scale up to 80 cores, 396GB memory and 5TB storage. [Documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/sql-database/single/)
   - Cons:
     - You only get single database. So, if you want to try out a lot of application, then it could get expesive.
   - Notes:
     - No SQL Server Agent on the database.
1. AWS RDS for SQL Server, SQL Server on GCP, Azure SQL Managed Instance
   - Pros:
     - Automated backups.
     - You can create multiple database on a single server.
   - Cons:
     - Starting price is very expensive.
     - Starting configuration have very less resources(Very low memory). Apps will not get good performance.
     - Need to pay more for automatic fail overs.

#### Selected design option: Option 1 will be default for the project. But we strongly recommend you to use option 2 if you have additional resources. Option 2 is batter suited for future scalability and development ease.
- Reasons for the selection:
  - Option 1 allows developers quickly start with Heroku using Heroku Postgres database.
  - Option 2 is batter suited for development tasks with Asp.net.
