#### Story:
As a developer of application<br/>
I want decide scaling strategy<br/>
So that all customers have very good user experience.

#### Design options evaluated:
1. Create application that scale horizontally to begin with.
   - Pros:
     - Need not to worry about scaling afterwards.
     - You automatically get highly available solution. Failure of single server will not cause application downtime.
   - Cons:
     - Expensive to create.
     - Slows down development.
     - Big invest for the idea that may not workout at the end.
1. Limit user sign-ups
   - Pros:
     - You can make sure that the existing users get good performance by making sure a lot of developers don't hog resources and slow down responsiveness for existing user.
     - Developer can get time to scale their app.
     - Doesn't require a large upfront investment to build an app.
     - Will force developers to squeeze max performance out of their machine.
   - Cons:
     - Will need to monitor server utilization and user experience continuously using tools like New Relic APM.(This could be counted as pro. Since, it will force you to monitor app performance.)
     - Application downtime if your single server application server fails. But this is OK for most cases. Distributed solution do have downtime too(Network failure or failure of their party service like payment gateway).(This could be counted as pro, since it will force you to think about how you should handle downtimes.)
